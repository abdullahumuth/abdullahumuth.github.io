## Project Overview

This research explored **multi-task symbolic regression** using **transformer architectures** to uncover interpretable physical relations in gravitational wave data.  
The approach leveraged **contrastive learning** to evaluate the likelihood of observed $(x, y)$ data under candidate symbolic expressions, aiming to bridge the gap between deep learning and analytical modeling in gravitational wave physics.
