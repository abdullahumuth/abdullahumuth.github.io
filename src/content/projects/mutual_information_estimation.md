This project was conducted as a research internship at Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich's PGI-8 Institute under the supervision of Dr. Markus Schmitt, from June 2024 to September 2024.

## Project Overview

I investigated mutual information as a proxy to predict the difficulty of learning wave functions using Neural Quantum States (NQS) in quantum many-body systems using transformers. This research explored the intersection of quantum physics, information theory, and modern machine learning architectures.

Here's the GitHub repository for this project: [Neural Quantum States with Transformers](https://github.com/abdullahumuth/mutualinformation)

## Key Contributions
