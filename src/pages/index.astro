	<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6">Research Experience</h2>
	<p class="text-lg mb-6">
	  My interdisciplinary background has shaped my research interests at the intersection of physics and machine learning:
	</p>
	<p class="text-lg mb-6">
	  <strong>Currently</strong>, I am conducting my Bachelor's thesis at Boğaziçi University under the supervision of Asst. Prof. İnci Meliha Baytaş and Asst. Prof. Arkadaş Özakin, developing an improved Constrained Lagrangian Neural Network (CLNN) that learns physical constraints directly from data.
	</p>
	<p class="text-lg mb-6">
	  <strong>Previously</strong>, I worked at Radboud University’s High Energy Physics group, where I developed transformer-based symbolic regression methods for interpretable modeling of gravitational wave signals and data-driven discovery of physical laws.
	</p>
	<p class="text-lg mb-6">
	  Before that, I interned at Forschungszentrum Jülich's PGI-8 Institute of Quantum Control, investigating mutual information as a measure of Neural Quantum State learnability using transformer architectures and information-theoretic methods for quantum many-body systems.
	</p>
	<p class="text-lg mb-6">
	  Earlier, I explored Lagrangian Neural Networks (LNNs) and symbolic regression under the guidance of Asst. Prof. Arkadaş Özakin at Boğaziçi University, showing how machine learning can infer theoretical quantities like the Lagrangian from data. I later presented these findings in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rbu45RuJc1c" target="_blank" class="text-primary hover:opacity-80 transition-opacity">seminar</a> I organized at my university.
